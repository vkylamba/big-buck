## Overview

The high-voltage buck converter in this project is designed to operate in applications where high input voltages (up to 600V DC) must be efficiently converted to a lower, stable output voltage (50V DC) with a power output of up to 1kW. This system is ideal for industrial applications, renewable energy systems, and other high-power applications requiring reliable DC-DC conversion. The addition of WiFi and Bluetooth capabilities allows for remote monitoring, diagnostics, and control.
