This repository provides the hardware design and firmware/software for a high-voltage DC-DC buck converter. The converter efficiently steps down a high-voltage input (up to 600V DC) to 50V DC at a maximum power output of 1kW. The system includes WiFi and Bluetooth monitoring capabilities for real-time performance tracking and diagnostics.
